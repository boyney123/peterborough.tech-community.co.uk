Fellow Humans,
At this profound point in my agile journey I look around me and despair as I witness *organisation* after *organisation* drowning in a sea of confusion about what agile is and what it is not.

#The true essence of agile

Desperate to transform in order to survive in an ever changing, ever more competitive commercial world, organisations reach out to 'agile professionals' for help, but all too often their trust is met by 'consultants' peddling 'snake oil agile' that do nothing more than act in their own self-interest and implement **hollow, flaccid processes** that loosely resemble something taken from a book or watched on you-tube. They have **no** concept or interest in the true essence of agile. The disillusioned, victim organisations are dragged further under-water and 'agile' takes the blame. It is not good. **It makes me sad :(**

> " ... empower individuals, elevate the team and promote genuine collaboration  ..."

 But all is not **lost** â€¦ I sense an emerging undercurrent, a backlash from the originators of agile and the frustrated many that try to hold true the vision of the original manifesto. It is my **humble** intention to try to create a spark, in the hope that it will unite and mobilise this groundswell of frustration and turn it into **positive action**.

 The agile I believe in **empowers** the individual, **elevates** the team and promotes genuine **collaboration** for the good of all. The organisations that want to survive and thrive must recognise the **waste** in software managers and project managers to see that they only serve as **obstacles**, like a self-promoting dam, that blocks, stifles and obscures direct, meaningful communication between the team and the customer. They are **not** necessary in a modern agile world, where **the team has the most important role**, they have to step aside to clear a path in which 'real' **value** can flow.

#The birth of a new movement 
I would like to start a new movement. This movement will be known as **'Natural Agile'** as I have come to believe with all my heart, that we are agile from birth and it is the most natural part of our daily existence. **Natural Agile**, because I believe that we must align our approach to software development to take advantage of our **instinctive** and **innate abilities**, as we stand on the shoulders of the great thought leaders that gave birth to the original agile movement.

Creating a well-defined **schism** will clearly differentiate the movement, maintaining **clarity** in an already crowded and confusing space.

In the true **spirit** of agile I have no idea where this journey is going to go, but I have enough passion to take that first scary step, **even if I fail**.

*At this moment, I feel as though I am lighting a candle in the dark and with a shaking hand raising it slowly to see if there is anyone else in the darkness with me, in the hope that we can join forces and unite behind this cause.*


**I am reaching out to anyone that shares this view and cares enough to want to 'really' make a change, I ask you to share this message around the world so that together we can take agile back!**

blurb: How and why I started Peterborough.tech-community.co.uk and how you can help the project and contribute.

I recently moved my [own blog platform](http://www.davidboyne.co.uk) over to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and enjoyed the experience of learning new things along the way.

I was learning about DNS registry’s, [how to host (multiple) websites on cheap digital ocean boxes](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-virtual-hosts-server-blocks-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts--3) and also how to quickly turn out cool static websites using ruby’s Jekyll platform. Also learnt a cool new method that allows me to host a [git server on the same box and allow me to push up changes straight to live within seconds](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-automatic-deployment-with-git-with-a-vps).

Whilst I was doing this it got me thinking of another new side project…(one I can hopefully complete)

**A community driven blog, free and open source.**

## The Project

With what I have learnt, I know how to manage it all technically but there are a few main issues that are out of my control:

-	Can I find people that would contribute?
-	Would people be interested?
-	Do people care?

These are the areas I will try to focus on within the next few months. How can I drive people to share, learn and grow within the local IT community?

## Reaching out and gaining interest

Every so often I run [IT events in Peterborough from speakers to workshops](http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Peterborough/). Through this I have met a lot of experienced and interesting people that all live locally within the area.

So I wondered if any of the people I know from work and hosting these events would be interesting in contributing to this open source project?

I reached out to the community and got a good number of people that said they were interested and would help out!

So hopefully this is just the **start of this open source project**.

blurb: A tester's job role is fast changing - how do you keep pace?

author: Neil Studd

The past few years has seen a marked change in the typical job role for a software tester. Testers are now working much more closely with developers, with a corresponding need to improve their technical skillset, much more so than many other areas of IT. The testing sphere is almost unrecognisable from when I first started working in QA in 2004, and those who aren't keeping pace with the change could find their opportunities very limited in the future.

## Why the change?

In the beginning (or at least for as long as agile practitioners have needed something to beat their stick against), there was waterfall. I've worked in organisations which have been working in waterfall-like structures, with gated processes at each stage of development, before finally throwing the code "over the wall" for the testers to validate.

Very few people would argue that the rapid rise of agile has been a bad thing for quality. Personally, I find that working alongside developers (and even writing code myself) is massively rewarding. However, it can be challenging for a lot of testers, who - for all of agile's benefits - liked living in the comfort zone of having a validation phase. Requirements were provided clearly up-front; there was plenty of time to extrapolate test cases to validate the requirements into cosy Excel test scripts; and when an issue was encountered during test, the requirements were a non-controversial oracle which they could use to decide if something had passed or failed. 

Because of this, many testers are resistant to change, to the extent that they're jeapordising their own future career chances, and also holding-back the potential of their current testing team. This is not out of malice, but out of fear, and I'd like to banish a few of those fears with a few simple pieces of advice.

## The grass really IS greener on the other side

Getting outside your comfort zone can be a real challenge. Often we feel that we're doing it in blind faith, simply because someone has told us that things will be better on the other side. Here's a practical example: I can't swim. I never learnt as a child. As an adult, I know that if I want to learn, all I need to do is take some lessons; yet I'm plagued by fears (What if I can't do it? Won't I look stupid flailing around?) and doubts (Will life really be better if I succeed? Can't I just stay in the shallow water?) 

Maybe I simply need a mentor, somebody to guide me through. In which case, I hope this article can serve as a similar reassuring hand for uncertain testers. I've been living in the new world of testing for a number of years now, and I can tell you that it's well worth the effort to upskill yourself.

When I worked in waterfall environments, I used to be very protective of my test scripts; I didn't want the developers to see them, because then they might write code to catch the pesky edge-case that I'd thought of, and I wouldn't get to log a bug! In hindsight, this was clearly foolish - it's far more efficient to work closely with developers, at the point when they're writing that potentially-flawed line of code, to catch that bug before it's ever introduced.

Similarly, I used to be very protective of my role boundaries. I was the tester; testing was my job! If anybody without "test" in their job title tried to undertake a testing activity, I would slap them down, just as I would've expected to have been slapped-down if I tried to write some production code. Yet nowadays, I can see the benefits of having much more fluid role boundaries. At Compare The Market, I still have "test" within my job title, but that's more because testing is my speciality; the whole team is responsible for quality (where I get to offer a guiding hand to what that quality level should be), and I'm now able to participate in a more diverse range of activities, including writing code within pair-programming or mob programming environments.

I'm amazed how far I've come, and how quickly. Which brings me on to my next point...

## The learning curve isn't as steep as you think

Gone are the days when you needed to buy an impenetrable 600-page book before you had any chance of learning a language. Heck, you don't even necessarily need to talk to any "real" people in order to progress your learning. There's a vast array of tutorials and resources online, if you know where to find them.

Sites like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com), [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) have a vast array of self-paced tutorials which can quickly take you from novice to adept. Then there's [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com), a subscription-based learning service which you may unknowingly already have free access to - Microsoft are currently bundling a free Pluralsight subscription with many of their Visual Studio licensing packages.

It's good to set aside a little time each week (or even each day) to undertake a lesson or two. And don't think that you have to do all of this in your free time; your employer has a commitment to enabling your professional development, so hopefully they will spare you some hours each week to pursue this within the office. 

## Strength in numbers

If you have several colleagues who all want to learn a particular language, it can be massively beneficial if you all follow along with the same material, as you'll be able to discuss tips and tricks as you learn. When I was studying C#, I did so with a colleague - we each dedicated two hours on a Wednesday afternoon to complete the same set of exercises. Once we'd completed them, we'd swap code and compare our solutions, which would often give us extra insight (sometimes her approach was more elegant than mine, and vice-versa).

You can scale this up even further by participating in mass group activities. Coding dojos and katas (such as those organised by [Agile Peterborough](http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Peterborough/) are a great way of learning within a group. If you'd rather do something from the comfort of your own home, I'm an organiser for [Weekend Testing](http://www.weekendtesting.com), which runs free monthly sessions over Skype for groups of 20-30 testers where we discuss techniques and undertake practical exercises. 

By following these tips, I hope you can begin to plot your path to a brighter testing future!

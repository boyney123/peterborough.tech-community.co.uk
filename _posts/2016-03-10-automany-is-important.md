*Blog from my website http://www.davidboyne.co.uk*

I recently came across [a thought provoking blog from Mike Hadlow](http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.il/2014/06/heisenberg-developers.html) which got me thinking about the importance of autonomy in teams and what it means for developers. In this post I will share from experience how autonomy can lead to motivated, self organising and passionate teams, and how dangerous things can get if teams don't have it or it's taken away from them.

##Teams 
I have been writing software for awhile now and over the course of my career I have worked with teams that are motivated, self driven and passionate. Teams that were motivated, self driven and passionate but lost it all over time and teams that never had it. Which most of the time is due to a lack of autonomy in the team and traditional management methodologies.

In short (in my opinion), traditional management consists of a hierarchy. We have a boss, the boss tells us what to do and we do it, and their boss tells them what to do (and so on). This style of management has worked for many years (and continues too), but recently I feel we are all learning that this isn't necessary the best way to manage software teams especially developers. We have to evolve.

> "...developers become disengaged, unmotivated and bored and eventually move on...."
 

Software development is a creative process and requires a lot of brain stimulation. All members of the team are creative in way one or another but for some reason software developers sometimes have the persona of just being code monkeys (build what I say and do as I say). 

Now some developers that just want the paycheck don't mind this attitude, but the developers that are passionate, self driven and motivated hate it. 

When this happens developers become **disengaged**, **unmotivated** and **bored** and eventually move on.


But what I have learnt is if we give individuals and teams more autonomy on what they do and how they do it they all get an increase in **engagement**, **motivation** and **passion**.
 
 Teams that a more driven, motivated and passionate will **always** outperform teams that are not. 

##Autonomy leads to a better outcomes for everybody

In the past teams and individuals I have worked with that have more autonomy with their life and job tend to be more motivated and driven. Leading to quality software, high motivated individuals and self driven teams. **Teams that actually care about what they do.**

Whereas teams with a lack of autonomy become disengaged, lose interest and motivation, leading to messy code, technical debt and attitudes where team members **don't necessarily care about what they do**. 

When we look at successful technology companies and try to understand how they are so successful, it normally comes down to **culture** and individuals/teams with drive, passion and motivation. 
 

##What does it all come down too?

I think it comes down to one thing. **Trust**.

I think software craftsmanship lives in an age where old traditional management no longer works. 

If you really want high performing motivated people and teams we need to learn how to give anatomy to them. Iâ€™m not saying just let teams decide what to do and when to do it, but guide them into decisions and work **together** to path the future. 

Traditional management methods still work today, it's why they have been around for so long, but if you want to create an atmosphere where individuals and teams are driven, motivated and passionate giving autonomy to teams **will** provide this.

            <p>Fellow Humans,<br />
At this profound point in my agile journey I look around me and despair as I witness <em>organisation</em> after <em>organisation</em> drowning in a sea of confusion about what agile is and what it is not.</p>

<p>Desperate to transform in order to survive in an ever changing, ever more competitive commercial world, organisations reach out to ‘<em>agile professionals</em>’ for help, but all too often their trust is met by ‘<em>consultants</em>’ peddling ‘<em>snake oil agile</em>’ that do nothing more than act in their own self-interest and implement <strong>hollow</strong>,<strong>flaccid</strong> <strong>processes</strong> that loosely resemble something taken from a book or watched on you-tube. They have <strong>no</strong> concept or interest in the true essence of agile. The disillusioned, victim organisations are dragged further under-water and ‘agile’ takes the blame. It is not good. <strong>It makes me sad :(</strong></p>

<p>But all is <strong>not</strong> lost … I sense an emerging undercurrent, a backlash from the originators of agile and the <em>frustrated</em> many that try to hold true the vision of the original manifesto. It is my <strong><em>humble</em></strong> intention to try to create a spark, in the hope that it will unite and mobilise this groundswell of frustration and turn it into <strong>positive action</strong>.</p>

<p>The agile I believe in <strong>empowers</strong> the individual, <strong>elevates</strong> the team and promotes genuine <strong>collaboration</strong> for the good of all. The organisations that want to survive and thrive must recognise the <strong>waste</strong> in layers of management and see that they only serve as <strong><em>obstacles</em></strong>, like a self-promoting dam, that blocks, stifles and obscures direct, meaningful communication between the team and the customer. They are <strong>not</strong> necessary in a modern agile world, where <strong>the team has the most important role</strong>, they have to step aside to clear a path in which ‘real’ <strong>value</strong> can flow.</p>

<h1 id="the-birth-of-a-new-movement">The birth of a new movement</h1>
<p>I would like to start a new movement. This movement will be known as ‘<strong>Natural</strong> <strong>Agile</strong>’ as I have come to believe with <em>all my heart</em>, that we are agile from birth and it is the most natural part of our daily existence. <strong>Natural</strong> <strong>Agile</strong>, because I believe that we must align our approach to software development to take advantage of our <strong>instinctive</strong> and <strong>innate</strong> <strong>abilities,</strong> as we stand on the shoulders of the great thought leaders that gave birth to the original agile movement.</p>

<p>Creating a well-defined <strong>schism</strong> will clearly differentiate the movement, maintaining <strong>clarity</strong> in an already crowded and confusing space.</p>

<p>In the true <strong>spirit</strong> of agile I have no idea where this journey is going to go, but I have enough passion to take that first scary step, <strong>even if I fail</strong>.</p>

<p><em>At this moment, I feel as though I am lighting a candle in the dark and with a shaking hand raising it slowly to see if there is anyone else in the darkness with me, in the hope that we can join forces and unite behind this cause.</em></p>

<p>I am reaching out to anyone that shares this view and <strong>cares</strong> enough to want to ‘really’ make a change, I ask you to <strong>share this message around the world</strong> so that <strong>together</strong> we can <strong>take agile back!</strong></p>

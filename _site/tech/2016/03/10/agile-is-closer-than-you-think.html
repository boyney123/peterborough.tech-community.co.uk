            <p>Throughout my working life I have had many different jobs … factory worker, coal miner and software engineer. Yet despite this apparent diversity I have come to realise that they all have something in common, me :) … but more specifically my desire to do the best I could at whatever it was that I was doing and take pride in my work. In the factories, I always strived to put more ‘handles on casserole dishes’ than the day before, by improving my technique, organising my equipment and putting plasters on my blisters! … when I worked in a meat factory, I challenged myself to beat my previous best time to haul 100 pork legs out of a 12 foot bath of cure with a 4 foot metal hook. When working down the pit, we pushed hard as a team to advance as far as we could by the end of the shift… making sure we left things ‘right’ for the shift following us on.</p>

<p>Now, as a  software developer the challenges seem endless and ever-changing and I have devoted the last 25 years trying to quench my thirst for technology, working hard to deepen my understanding and trying to keep up… the desire that has driven me is a natural part of who I am… so now it gets interesting.</p>

<p>Throughout these work experiences I have not been alone, in every place I have ever worked, I have worked shoulder to shoulder with others that have shared the same attitude, sense of pride and work ethic as me… and further in every place I have ever worked it has always been the guys/girls on the shop floor/the sharp end that really knew what was going on… where the problems were… how things could be improved and yet every time their voices were not heard… why? and what has this got to do with agile?</p>

<p>After years of working in agile teams and wrestling with books and blogs, even doing my CSM, trying to understand what this seemingly mythical intangible ‘thing called agile’ was I have come to realise that… ‘I am agile’ … my spirit and attitude, values and principles are the embodiment of agile… as is yours and that of all the other hard-working motivated people I have shared my working life with.</p>

<p>If you care about your work you are agile … if you want to work hard for your team you are agile … if you want to improve you are agile … if your highest priority is your customer guess what :) ?</p>

<p>Agile is about culture, people who care and take pride in what they do, working together to do something awesome for someone else… its natural, selfless human behaviour, caring and sharing , learning and growing together… and when experienced is pure magic. When I think about those rare, special moments I have enjoyed as part of great ‘agile’ teams [Energy :)] and we got it over the line… that kind of magic.</p>

<p>So please don’t get caught up in the dusty, tangled webs spun by countless weavers of confusion,terminology, rules  and process …  it mustn’t be allowed to obscure the agile light that shines in every one of us…  listen to your heart.</p>

<p>In software development, agile is all about the team, they are the guys on the shop floor, they live and breathe the code… they feel the pain of flaky build servers… they know and love their products better than anyone… they are ones that know best.</p>

<p>You are agile … and as an organisation, if you want to realise the true magic of agile (it’s also closer than you think!) … empower the team and they wont let you down :)</p>

<p>I believe above all that ‘motivated individuals’ are at the heart of being agile… so if you care about the software you build, you’re off to great start.</p>
